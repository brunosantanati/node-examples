- The code in this repo represents the playground code that is written in the course.
- I ended up calling the project node-examples instead of playground.
- I also suspect that I included files unrelated to the course in the src folder.
  It's been quite a long time I started doing this course and I don't remember it.
- I also used a different naming convention than the course what 
  made difficult to relate my files with the course's examples after some time.
  So, I'm commiting this playground folder with identical examples from the course,
  and hopefully it will make things easier to follow along with the course. 
  I'm using this folder and files from now on.
